Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aR6RScKI84EQqF5mxH-UELdlo4RSWOuj?usp=sharing  
Analysed different types of concrete and trying to predict the compressive strength of a given type based on the ingredients and age of the concrete  
Used multiple models and then optimizing the one with the best performance to make my predictions
